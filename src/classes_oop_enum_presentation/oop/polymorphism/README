Polymorphism also known as multiforme.
Objects of different classes_oop_enum_presentation.classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
Polymorphism means that a variable of a supertype can refer to a subtype object

A class defines a type. A type defined by a subclass is called a subtype, and a type
defined by its superclass is called a supertype. Therefore, you can say that
Student is a subtype of Person and Person is a supertype for Student.

In other words, it is the ability of objects to return different responses to the same request.
